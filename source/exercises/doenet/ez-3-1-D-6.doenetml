  Consider a spherical tank of radius <m>$r</m> meters.  When water in the tank is <m>h</m> meters deep, the total volume of water in the tank is given by the relationship
  <me>V = $r\pi h^2 - \frac{\pi}{3}h^3,</me>
which is valid for <m>0 \le h \le $maxHeight</m>.

        Draw several pictures of the tank filled to different water levels, imagining that the tank is initially empty and then filling as time goes on.
