  Consider two autonomous differential equations that model physical phenomena.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        For an object in a room with ambient temperature <m>$R</m>, the object's temperature, <m>F</m> is a function of time that satisfies the differential equation 
        <me>
          \frac{dF}{dt} = -$k(F-$R)
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For a bank account that earns <m>$r</m>% interest per year and from which the owner withdraws $<m>$W</m> per year, the amount of money in the account, <m>A</m>, is a function of time that satisfies the differential equation 
        <me>
          \frac{dA}{dt} = <math simplify>0.01*$r</math>A - $W
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Use these differential equations to respond to the following prompts.

        The equilibrium solution to the temperature differential equation, <m>\frac{dF}{dt} = -$k(F-$R)</m>, is <m>F = </m><answer>$R</answer>.  In addition, this equilibrium is <choiceInput inline name="a1">

        The equilibrium solution to the bank account differential equation, <m>\frac{dA}{dt} = <math simplify>0.01*$r</math>A - $W</m>, is <m>A = </m><answer allowedErrorInNumbers="0.01" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$W/(0.01*$r)</answer>.  In addition, this equilibrium is <choiceInput inline name="b1">
          <choice>?</choice>
          <choice>stable</choice>
          <choice>unstable</choice>
        </choiceInput> because if the account's initial balance is greater than the equilibrium solution, the account balance will <choiceInput inline name="b2">
          <choice>?</choice>
          <choice>decrease toward 0</choice>
          <choice>increase without bound</choice>
        </choiceInput>, while if the account's initial balance is less than the equilibrium solution, then the account balance will <choiceInput inline name="b3">
          <choice>?</choice>
          <choice>decrease toward 0</choice>
          <choice>increase without bound</choice>
        </choiceInput>.  This shows that for this differential equation, the equilibrium solution represents the minimum initial account balance for which the annual interest earned is at least as much as the amount being withdrawn annually.
