  For an object in a room with surrounding temperature <m>$eq</m> degrees Fahrenheit, it turns out that the object's temperature at time <m>t</m> (in minutes) is modeled by the differential equation
  <me>
    \frac{dF}{dt} = -$k (F - $eq)
  </me>
  Use this differential equation to respond to the following prompts
</p>
<p>  
  <ol marker="a.">
    <li>
      <p>
        For each of the following functions, use substitution into the differential equation to determine whether the function is or is not a solution to <m>\frac{dF}{dt} = -$k (F - $eq)</m>.  Then, check all of the boxes that correspond to solutions.

        Look at each of the (three) correct answers to part (a) and think about what they have in common.  Complete the following sentence to explain why one common feature of the solutions to the differential equation makes sense.

        as <m>t</m> increases without bound, it follows that each of the three correct solutions from (a) approaches <choiceInput name="b2" inline>

          <choice>70</choice>
