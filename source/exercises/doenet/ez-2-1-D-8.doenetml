    Suppose you make an investment of $<m>$P</m> in a mutual fund in the year 2025 (which we will view as <m>t = 0</m>), and the fund earns average annual interest of <m><math simplify>($b-1)*100</math></m>%.  The total amount of money in your account <m>t</m> years after your initial investment is given by the function <m>A(t) = $A</m>. <!-- <math>$$h(t)</math> -->

        The billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously bought his first mutual fund when he was just 11 years old. Buffett is also well-known for understanding the time value of money:  it matters not just how much interest your money returns, but even more for how long that interest compounds.

        In part (b), we saw how much money had accumulated in our mutual fund after  <m>$c</m> years, as well as how fast it was growing at that time.
