          and this suggests that it's best to integrate with respect to <m>y</m>.  To do so, we need to make sure each of the equations that generate the curves are written so that <m>x</m> is a function of <m>y</m>.  Thus, we need to solve the equation <m>y =  <math simplify>$m x + $b</math></m> for <m>x</m>.  Doing so, we find that
