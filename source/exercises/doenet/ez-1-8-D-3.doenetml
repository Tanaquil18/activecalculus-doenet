<p>The temperature, <m>C</m>, in degrees Celcius, of a hot cup of coffee placed on a kitchen counter is given by <m>C=f(t)</m>, where  <m>t</m> is in minutes since the coffee was put on the counter.

      <p>We can find the local linearization to <m>C</m> at <m>a = $t</m>, which is
        <me>
          L(t) = C($t) + C'($t)(t-$t) = $$C($t) - <math simplify>|$$CP($t)|</math>(t-$t).
        </me>
        Using the local linearization, we find that <m>f(<math simplify>$t + $tplus</math>) \approx L(<math simplify>$t + $tplus</math>) = </m><answer  allowedErrorInNumbers="0.01" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$$C($t) + $tplus*$$CP($t)</answer>.  Thus, if $tplus more minutes elapse after <m>t=$t</m>, we expect that the coffee's temperature will drop by about <answer  allowedErrorInNumbers="0.01" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>-1*$tplus*$$CP($t)</answer> degrees C.
