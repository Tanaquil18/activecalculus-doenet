  An oil slick in the ocean is forming as the result of a leak from an oil tanker; scientists monitor the changing oil slick from a helicopter and use digital technology to measure its radius at diﬀerent points in time. The slick is in the shape of a thin cylinder with radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> and the top of the thin cylinder sits on the surface of the ocean.
</p>  

<p>
  First, draw 2-3 diﬀerent pictures of the slick as viewed at diﬀerent points in time, showing how different aspects of the slick might change.
</p>

<p>
  Suppose we know the following information:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> 
        the radius of the oil slick is always $a times the thickness of the oil slick;
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        at the instant the radius is $b meters, the radius is increasing at an instantaneous rate of $c meters per hour.
      </p>  
    </li>
  </ul>  
  Determine each of the following quantities, including units on each.
