<p>
  In our discussion near the end of this section, we learned that if <m>f</m> is a function with an inverse and <m>g</m> is its inverse function, then for any point <m>(a,b)</m> on the graph of <m>f</m> (for which <m>f'(a) \ne 0</m>), it follows that
    <me>g'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(a)}.</me>
</p>  

<p>
  Let <m>f(x) = $a x + $b \sin(x)</m>. 
</p>  


<p>
  <ol marker="a.">
    <li>
      <p>
        First, find <m>f'(x)</m>: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>f'(x)=</m><answer>$fP</answer>.
      </p>  
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Now, observe that since <m>-1 \le \cos(x) \le 1</m>, it follows that <m>f'(x)</m> is always <answer>
                <choiceInput inline>
                  <choice>?</choice>
                  <choice credit="1">positive</choice>
                  <choice>negative</choice>
                  <choice>zero</choice>
                </choiceInput>  
              </answer>,
so <m>f(x)</m> is always <answer>
                <choiceInput inline>
                  <choice>?</choice>
                  <choice>decreasing</choice>

                </choiceInput>  
              </answer>, which guarantees that <m>f</m> has an inverse function (which we will call <q><m>g</m></q>).  Note that since the domain and range of <m>f</m> are both <q>all real numbers</q>, it follows that <m>g</m> is also defined for all real numbers.

    <li>
      <p>
         Observe that <m>f($c) = <math simplify>$$f($c)</math> \approx $fc</m>, so the point <m>($c, $fc)</m> lies on the graph of <m>f</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that <m>g</m> is the inverse of <m>f</m>.  Determine <m>g'($fc) = </m><answer allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>1/($$fP($c))</answer>
