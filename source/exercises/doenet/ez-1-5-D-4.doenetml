      Complete the following sentences to explain the meaning of the information contained in the equations <m>f($mph) = $mpg</m> and <m>f'($mph)=$rate</m>.  
    </p>  
    <p>
      When the car is traveling at a speed of <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$mph</award></answer> miles per hour, its gas mileage is <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$mpg</award></answer> miles per gallon, and its gas mileage is changing at an instantaneous rate of <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$rate</award></answer> miles per gallon per mile per hour.  Thus, when the car is traveling at <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$mph</award></answer> miles per hour, if its speed increases by <m>2</m> miles per hour, we expect its fuel economy to decrease by about <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute><math simplify>-2 * $rate</math></award></answer> miles per gallon.
