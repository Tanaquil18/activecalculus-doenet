<p> 
  Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of <m>$a</m> cubic feet per minute. It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter is always <m>$b</m> times the cone's height.  Through the following sequence of questions, we'll determine how fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is <m>$c</m> feet high.
</p>

<p>
  Recall that the volume of a right circular cone with height <m>h</m> and radius of the base <m>r</m> is given by <m> V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>.  Before responding to the first question, draw several different pictures of the cone of gravel that represent how the pile changes as time advances.

        Part of the given information tells us that the pile grows in such a way that its <q> base diameter is always <m>$b</m> times the cone's height</q>.  If we let <m>d</m> be the diameter of the cone's base and <m>h</m> the cone's height, then the given information tells us that <answer><choiceInput inline>

          <choice><m>h = $b d</m></choice>

          <choice credit="1"><m>d = $b h</m></choice>
        </choiceInput></answer>.  Using the fact that the radius, <m>r</m> of the base is half of the diameter of the base, we can conclude the following relationship between <m>r</m> and <m>h</m> for every value of time, <m>t</m>:  <answer><choiceInput inline>

        </choiceInput></answer>.

        Next, while the volume of gravel depends on both the base radius and height through the equation <m>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m>, our work in (a) allows us to simplify this relationship and show how the volume can be expressed entirely in terms of only <m>r</m> or only <m>h</m>.  Since we ultimately want to know how fast the height of the pile is changing at a certain height, it makes sense that we express volume in terms of height.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the expression you found in (a) that tells us how <m>r</m> depends on <m>h</m>, and substitute this expression in <m>V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h</m> to write <m>V</m> in terms of only <m>h</m>.

    <li>
      <p>
        Now that we have related volume to only height, we can determine how the rate of change of volume, <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> is related to the rate of change of height, <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Differentiate with respect to <m>t</m> on both sides of the equation you found in (b) to find a new equation that relates <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dh}{dt}</m>.

      <p>
        Finally, use your result in (c) and the given information appropriately to find the instantaneous rate of change of the cone's height at the instant <m>h = $c</m> feet high.  Don't forget that we know how fast gravel is being added to the pile.
