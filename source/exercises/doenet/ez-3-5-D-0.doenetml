    Let <m>f</m> be the piecewise linear function given by the graph below.
</p>
      <graph xmin="-5" xmax="5" ymin="-5" ymax="5" size="medium" grid="true" showNavigation="false" fixAxes="true"> $f   
          <label fixLocation anchor="($x1+0.5,$$f($x1)-0.25)"><m>f</m></label>
      </graph>

<p>
  Consider the function <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[$p,$q]</m>. Reasoning graphically, use calculus to find the exact absolute minimum and absolute maximum of <m>f</m> on this interval.
</p>  

<p>
  <ol marker="a.">
    <li>
      <p>
        Find all critical numbers of <m>f</m>.  If there is more than one critical number, enter them as a list separated by commas.  If there are none, enter <em>none</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The critical numbers of <m>f</m> are: <m>x=</m> <answer> $crNum</answer>
      </p>  
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The exact values of the function at the respective endpoints of the interval are:

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to also consider any critical number that lies in the interval <m>[$p,$q]</m> and evaluate the function at such critical numbers.
