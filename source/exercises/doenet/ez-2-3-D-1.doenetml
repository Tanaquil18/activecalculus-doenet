  Suppose that <m>p(x) = $p</m>.  
</p>
<p>  
  Since the algebraic structure of <m>p</m> is that <m>p(x)</m> is the product of two basic functions, to find <m>p'(x)</m> we need to use the product rule.  Let's say that <m>p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)</m>, where <m>f(x)</m> is the first function in the product and <m>g(x)</m> is the second function.
</p>  

<p>
  Fill in the following blanks to identify  <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> and their derivatives.

Now we can apply the product rule to find the derivative of <m>p(x) = $p</m>.  The product rule tells us that the derivative of the product of two functions <m>f</m> (the first) and <m>g</m> (the second) is 
    <q><em>the first times the derivative of the second, plus the second times the derivative of the first</em>.</q> 
    Applying this structure, we see that
