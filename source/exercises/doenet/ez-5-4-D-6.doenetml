  In this question, we use Integration by Parts along with limited information about a function <m>g</m> (whose formula is not known) to evaluate the definite integral 
  <me>
    \int_$a^$b x g'(x) \, dx.
  </me>
Suppose we know that
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>g($a) = $k</m>,
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>g($b) = $m</m>, and
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>\int_$a^$b g(x) \,dx = $p </m>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Using Integration by parts with <m>u = x</m> and <m>dv = g'(x) \, dx</m>, fill in the blanks below.
</p>

<p>
  <m>\int_$a^$b x g'(x) \, dx = </m> <mathInput name="uv"/> <m>\bigg|_$a^$b - \int_$a^$b</m> <mathInput name="vdu"/> <m>dx</m> <answer symbolicEquality unorderedCompare><award><when>($uv = x*g(x)) and ($vdu = g(x))</when></award></answer>
