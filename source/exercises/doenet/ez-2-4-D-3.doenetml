  In this exercise, we analyze the signs of the first derivatives of <m>f(x) = $f</m> and <m>g(x) = $g</m>, plus we learn how to find their respective second derivatives and to see some of the information the second derivative reveals.

        Reasoning similarly for <m>g(x) = $g</m>, while <m>g'(x)</m> is not defined for every <m>x</m> (for example, <m>-\csc^2(\pi)</m> is undefined, just like <m>\cot(\pi)</m> is undefined), but because of the algebraic form of <m>g'(x)</m> that you noted in (a), it follows that <m>g'(x)</m> is <answer>

        (These results should make sense to you in comparison to the familiar graphs of <m>f(x) = $f</m> and <m>g(x) = $g</m>; if you don't know those graphs by heart, use a graphing utility to plot them and compare how they look to your observations above.)

        Now, for <m>f(x) = $f</m>, write <m>f'(x) = \sec(x) \cdot \sec(x)</m>.  Use the product rule to find a formula for <m>f''(x)</m> and then find the requested values of <m>f''(-\frac{\pi}{3})</m> and <m>f''(\frac{\pi}{3})</m> below.

        We can use the formula for <m>f''(x)</m> to show that for all <m>x</m> in the interval <m>-\frac{\pi}{2} < x < 0</m>, <m>f''(x) < 0</m> and thus on this interval, <m>f(x) = $f</m> is <answer>

        (Like in part (b), you should confirm that this result aligns with  your understanding of how the graph of <m>f(x) = $f</m> appears.)
