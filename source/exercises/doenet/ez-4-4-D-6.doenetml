  A large cylindrical tank has a small hole in the bottom and starts to drain.  The rate at which water leaves the tank is given by the function <me>r(t) = $k(t-$t0)^2,</me> which is valid from <m>t = 0</m> (when the tank begins to drain) until <m>t = $t0</m> (when the tank is empty).  Assume that <m>t</m> is measured in minutes and <m>r(t)</m> in liters per minute.
