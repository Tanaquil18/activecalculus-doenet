      Complete the following sentences to explain the meaning of the information contained in the equations <m>f($num6) = $num7</m> and <m>f'($num6)=$num8</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>  
      When the car has been driven <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$num6</award></answer> miles, its value is <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$num7</award></answer> dollars, and its value is changing at an instantaneous rate of <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$num8</award></answer> dollars per mile.  Thus, when the car has been driven <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$num6</award></answer> miles, if the car is driven <m>5</m> more miles, we expect the car's value to drop by approximately <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute><math simplify>-5 * $num8</math></award></answer> dollars.
