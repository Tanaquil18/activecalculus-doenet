<p>
  Suppose that <m>q(x) = \frac{$T}{$B}</m>.  
</p>
<p>  
  Since the algebraic structure of <m>q</m> is that <m>q(x)</m> is the quotient of two basic functions, to find <m>q'(x)</m> we need to use the qroduct rule.  Let's say that <m>q(x) = \frac{T(x)}{B(x)}</m>, where <m>T(x)</m> is the top function in the quotient (the numerator) and <m>B(x)</m> is the bottom function (the denominator).
</p>  

<p>
  Fill in the following blanks to identify  <m>T(x)</m> and <m>B(x)</m> and their derivatives.
</p>  

<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell><m>T(x)=</m><answer><award>$T</award></answer></cell>
    <cell><m>T'(x)=</m><answer><award>$TP</award></answer></cell>
  </row>  
  <row>
    <cell><m>B(x)=</m><answer><award>$B</award></answer></cell>
    <cell><m>B'(x)=</m><answer><award>$BP</award></answer></cell>
  </row>    
</tabular>  

<p>
Now we can apply the quotient rule to find the derivative of <m>q(x) = \frac{$T}{$B}</m>.  The quotient rule tells us that the derivative of the quotient of two functions <m>T</m> (the top) and <m>B</m> (the bottom) is 
    <q><em>the bottom times the derivative of the top, minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom function squared</em>.</q> 
    Applying this structure, we see that 
</p>
<p>
  <m>q'(x) = (</m><answer><award>$B</award></answer><m>\cdot</m><answer><award>$TP</award></answer><m>-</m><answer><award>$T</award></answer><m>\cdot</m><answer><award>$BP</award></answer><m>)/(</m> <answer><award>$B</award></answer><m>)^2</m>.
