        At the instant <m>t = $inst</m>, the car's velocity is <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$vel</award></answer> feet per second, and the car's velocity is changing at an instantaneous rate of <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$velP</award></answer> <answer><choiceInput inline>

      <choice credit = "0">seconds per foot</choice>
      <choice credit = "0">seconds</choice>
    </choiceInput></answer>.  This means that if one more second of time elapsed from <m>t = $inst</m> to <m>t = <math simplify>$inst + 1</math></m>, we'd expect the car's velocity to decrease to approximately <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$vel + $velP</award></answer> feet per second.

        Now let <m>s(t)</m> represent the distance the car has traveled since it started braking at <m>t = 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that <m>s($inst2) = $pos</m> and <m>v($inst2) = $vel2</m>, this means that at the instant <m>t = $inst2</m>, the distance the car has traveled is increasing at an instantaneous rate of <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$vel2</award></answer> <answer><choiceInput inline>

In other words, if one more second of time elapsed from <m>t = $inst2</m> to <m>t = <math simplify>$inst2 + 1</math></m>, we'd expect the car's distance traveled at <m>t = <math simplify>$inst2 + 1</math></m> to be approximately <answer><award allowedErrorInNumbers="0.1" allowedErrorIsAbsolute>$pos + $vel2</award></answer> feet.
