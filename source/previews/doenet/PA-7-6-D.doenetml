  We consider two different possible models for population growth and compare their long-term behavior.

           Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size, which corresponds to a differential equation such as 
          <me>
            \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac12 P
          </me>
          A plot of the slope field for this differential equation is shown at left above.

Enter your responses as lists separated by commas if there is more than one (with equilibrium solutions in increasing order).
