    According to U.S. postal regulations, the size of a parcel sent by mail 
    must satisfy certain constraints. Let's find the largest possible volume
    of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by U.S. mail.
  </p>

    <ol marker="a.">
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> represent the length of one side of the square end and <m>y</m> the length of another edge of the box. Assume <m>x\lt y</m>.
          Label these quantities appropriately on the image below.

      <li>
        <p>
          State an expression involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that gives the volume of the box (which is the quantity we wish to optimize).

      <li>
        <p>
          The <q>girth</q> of the box is defined to be the perimeter of its square
side of the box.  According to U.S. mail regulations, the box's girth plus the length of its
other side cannot exceed <m>108</m> inches.
        </p>
        <p>
          State an equation involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that is satisfied when the box's girth plus the length of its remaining side equals <m>108</m> inches.

      <li>
        <p>
          Solve the equation
          <mathInput disabled>$girthEq</mathInput>
          that you found in (c) for the variable <m>y</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          Now, use your results from (a) and (d) to find a function
          <m>V(x)</m> of only the variable <m>x</m> whose output is the quantity
          to be optimized.

      <p>
        <m>V(x)=</m><answer>108x^2-4x^3</answer>

      <li>
        <p>
          Over what domain should we consider this function?
        </p>
        <p>  
          The smallest value allowed for either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is zero;
          given the constraint <mathInput disabled>$girthEq</mathInput> found in part (c),
          what is the largest value possible for <m>x</m>?
        </p>
      <p>
        The minimum possible value for <m>x</m> is <answer name="min">0</answer> and
        the maximum possible value for <m>x</m> is <answer name="max">108/4</answer>, so
        the domain of <m>V</m> in interval notation is <mathInput disabled>[$min,$max]</mathInput>.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x)</m> has exactly one critical number that lies strictly between the endpoints of the domain <mathInput disabled>[$min,$max]</mathInput>. What is that critical numbers?
        </p>
        <p>
          By first finding <m>f'(x)=</m><answer>216x-12x^2</answer>, and then setting <m>f'(x) = </m> <answer>0</answer> and solving for <m>x</m>, we find that the only critical number strictly between the endpoints of the domain is <answer name="critical">18</answer>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
            Find the value of <m>f(x)</m> at each endpoints of its domain and this critical number.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>V(</m> <mathInput disabled>$min</mathInput><m>) =</m><answer>0</answer>.

          <m>V(</m> <mathInput disabled>$max</mathInput><m>) =</m><answer>0</answer>.
        </p>

        </p> 
      </li>
      <li>
        In conclusion, we find that the box of largest possible volume that can be shipped has a square end where each side has length <m>x = </m><answer>18</answer> inches and the remaining side has length <m>y = </m><answer>36</answer>, and thus the maximum volume is <m>V = </m><answer>11664</answer> cubic inches.

          Describe the dimensions length <m>\times</m> width <m>\times</m> height, and overall volume, of the largest box that can be shipped via U.S. mail.  Then write a sentence or two explaining the calculus used to ensure that this value is optimized.
