  <p>
    A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.  How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when <m>d = 12</m> or when <m>d = 16</m>? Why?

          On a sheet of paper, draw several spheres that reflect spheres of different volume.  As the volume changes, what other attributes of the sphere change?  Check all that apply.

      <li>
        <p>
          Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius <m>r</m> is <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>.  Note well that in the setting of this problem, <em>both</em> <m>V</m> and <m>r</m> are changing as time <m>t</m> changes, and thus both <m>V</m> and <m>r</m> may be viewed as implicit functions of <m>t</m>, with respective derivatives <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m> with respect to <m>t</m> (using the chain rule on the right) to find a formula for <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> that depends on both <m>r</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.

      </p>
 
      <li>
        <p>
          At this point in our work, by differentiating we have <q>related the rates</q> of change of <m>V</m> and <m>r</m>.  Recall that we are given that the balloon is being inflated at a constant <em>rate</em> of 20 cubic inches per second.

          From part (c), we know the value of <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> at every value of <m>t</m>. Next, observe that when the diameter of the balloon is 12, we know the value of the radius.
